    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the ultimate page showcasing the varieties of dragons that live in
        our everyday lore! We will only be covering the basic species in this lesson,
        so sit back and read through the history of these amazing creatures of our fantasies.</p>
    <hr>
    <div>
        <h2>Dragon</h2>
        <img width="400" height="400" src="image/dragondd.jpg" alt="Traditional Dragon">
        <p>The most commonly recognized, Dragons are the four-legged creatures which come in
            a variety of colors. Many times, Dragons will be from Black, Red, and even White.
            The color scheme of each dragon determine its behavior and wether it is considered
            good or evil. Typically, metallic colored dragons (Bronze, Silver, Brass) are
            good by nature, while chromatic dragons (Black, Red, Blue) tend to be more evil in
            tendencies.
            <br>
            The Dragon breathes fire by nature, and can destroy entire villages and cities
            with ease. Depending on the dragon, they may also combine these attacks with
            Magika, but aren't notorious to do so. Dragons are of course, very strong
            against any type of fire due to this. However, depending on the type of Dragon,
            their "flames" can be of many types including frost, poison, or dark matter.
            </p>

    <br>
    <div>
        <h2>Wyvern</h2>
        <img width="400" height="400" src="image/Wyvern.jpg" alt="Wyvern Dragon">
            <p>The Wyvern is a smaller cousin of the larger Dragon species, falling into
            the family of Wyrms and Drakes. Wyverns are most difficult to tame due to
            their hearts being located on their backs. This means a strong bond must be
            built with one before being able to have it as a steed.
                <br>
            In addition, the Wyvern does not breathe traditional fire, but rather lightning
            energy. They use this ability as a destruction method, as well as to malipulate
            their foes by hurling them into the sky with their breath and magika abilities.
            Being that the Wyvern is specialized in lightning, they are rather resistant
            to attacks of this nature.
                <br>
            The Wyvern is also a skilled flyer, and are often times difficult to target
            when in the air. Its very useful for its attacker to ground the dragon (using
            many means, such as the Dragonrend shout) before attacking it.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Drake</h2>
        <img width="500" height="375" src="image/drake.jpg" alt="Drake Dragon">
            <p>The Drake is much like the dragon, only smaller in stature and often without wings.
                Drakes are much more common in appearance than dragons and most Wyverns, making
                them often times the "go-to" image for your typical dragon. The Drake is also
                much stronger than its Wyvern cousin.
                <br>
            The Drake dragon is well-versed in its use of the fire elements, so understandably
            they possess a strength against these attack types. They are, however, weak against
            ice attacks and ice elements/magika. Drakes also posess a weakness in their chest,
                where their heart resides rather vulnerably. Their fiery breath is known to melt iron and
                durable metals, making them a dreaded visitor.
                <br>

    <div>
        <h2>Wyrm</h2>
        <img width="500" height="375" src="image/wyrm.png" alt="Wyrm Dragon">
        <p>Wyrms are known for their agility and proficiency in magic-casting. In addition to
            this, Wyrm's are known to typically possess powerful frost/ice capabilities, and
            use this to their advantage in conjunction with their magika attacks. This does
            make them weak to fire elements and attacks.
            <br>
            Wyrms do not fly much, as they tend to possess a serpent-like body. While their
            agility on land can seem intimidating, the Wyrm's stomach glows red due to their
            heart being located in it. When weakened, this is an easy target to strike.
