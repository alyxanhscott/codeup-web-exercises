    <h1>Dragon Species of the World</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the ultimate page showcasing the varieties of dragons that live in
        our everyday lore! We will only be covering the basic species in this lesson,
        so sit back and read through the history of these amazing creatures of our fantasies.</p>

    <h2>Dragon</h2>

    <p>The most commonly recognized, Dragons are the four-legged creatures which come in
        a variety of colors. Many times, Dragons will be from Black, Red, and even White.
        The color scheme of each dragon determine its behavior and wether it is considered
        good or evil. Typically, metallic colored dragons (Bronze, Silver, Brass) are
        good by nature, while chromatic dragons (Black, Red, Blue) tend to be more evil in
        tendencies.
        <br>
        The Dragon breathes fire by nature, and can destroy entire villages and cities
        with ease. Depending on the dragon, they may also combine these attacks with
        Magika, but aren't notorious to do so. Dragons are of course, very strong
        against any type of fire due to this. However, depending on the type of Dragon,
        their "flames" can be of many types including frost, poison, or dark matter.

    <h2>Wyvern</h2>

        <p>The Wyvern is a smaller cousin of the larger Dragon species, falling into
        the family of Wyrms and Drakes. Wyverns are most difficult to tame due to
        their hearts being located on their backs. This means a strong bond must be
        built with one before being able to have it as a steed.
            <br>
        In addition, the Wyvern does not breathe traditional fire, but rather lightning
        energy. They use this ability as a destruction method, as well as to malipulate
        their foes by hurling them into the sky with their breath and magika abilities.
        Being that the Wyvern is specialized in lightning, they are rather resistant
        to attacks of this nature.
            <br>
        The Wyvern is also a skilled flyer, and are often times difficult to target
        when in the air. Its very useful for its attacker to ground the dragon (using
        many means, such as the Dragonrend shout) before attacking it.</p>
